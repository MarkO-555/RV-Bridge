## Features

* Connects to RV-C network in many recent model RVs
    * RV-C is a subset of CAN-Bus running at 250kbps
* Uses ESP32 with a CAN-Bus interface
* Connects lights, fans, and thermostats to HomeKit
* Plugs into unused CAN-Bus socket inside RV control panel.
* STL files for 3D printed case are included.

## Background

At the start of the pandemic we realized that international travel was going to be off the table for a significant duration. We decided it was time to see more of the US West so we bought a class-A motorhome which we call The Penguin Express. We've put [almost 30k miles on it so far](http://rickandrandy.com/?rvlife).

In addition to a bunch of 3D printed upgrades (we travel with a Prusa MK3S on board) I've done some arduino powered electronics work: a water valve for a reverse osmosis water filter with an LCD control panel, a GPS based clock for the bedroom that knows the exact timezone boundaries so it never needs to be set, and a gps based altimeter and tire pressure monitor with a 7" color display for the dash.

The RV's lights, fans, and climate are all controlled through a [Firefly Integrations](https://fireflyint.com) [Vegatouch Spectrum](https://www.vegatouch.com) multiplex system. A 10" LCD panel is used to control everything, in addition to wireless keypads around the RV. There is also a bluetooth module that connects to an iOS app for controlling via an iPhone.

It's a great system and works really well for control around the RV, but the iOS app is a bit slow to load/connect and can only be used in proximity to the RV. I've always wondered if there was a way to control it all via HomeKit and the Home app.

Recently I came across some documentation for the bus protocol that's used by the Spectrum system, RV-C, a subset of CAN-Bus, as well as the open source project [CoachProxyOS](https://github.com/linuxkidd/coachproxy-os) that documents getting a Raspberry Pi set up to host a web page for controlling an RV's network using RV-C.

I also recently started playing with [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan), a library for implementing HomeKit accessories on an ESP-32 microcontroller, for a HomeKit doorbell project.

This project is the result of putting these pieces together.

## Current Project State

* Homespan pairing works, devices show up in Home app.
* CAN-Bus receiving works.
* CAN-Bus messages route correctly to HomeKit devices.
* Correct RV-C messages are being sent over the bus.
* RV devices respond correctly.
* Lights, switches, and fans are complete.

---
## To-Do:

* Verify thermostat functions.

## Hardware

Uses an ESP32 with a CAN-Bus interface, either separate components, or more easily:

![ESP32 Module](/images/board_in_box.jpeg)

You can find this on the CopperHillTech Website:<br>
[ESP32 with WiFi, Bluetooth Classic, BLE, CAN Bus Module](https://copperhilltech.com/esp32-wifi-bluetooth-classic-ble-can-bus-module/)

This board has everything needed, including a regulator for powering the device off of the 12V provided by the RV-C connector.

## Wiring

Connector is a 3M 37104-A165-00E MB and can be sourced from [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/3m/37104-A165-00E%2520MB/1855697)

Insert 24AWG wires into Can-Bus connector and compress to make connections. Twist the data and power pairs together and screw into the terminal block on the CAN-Bus interface on the ESP32.

The CAN-Bus connector plugs into one of the available sockets on the system wiring panel.

## Firmware Setup

- Project is set up for compilation with PlatformIO
- `config.h`
    * Rename `config-sample.h` to `config.h`.
    * Enter Wifi SSID and password for the RV network.
    * Include a definition file for the RV devices (see `Miramar_2020_3202.h` for an example)
        * Each light will have an output number and a name, and a flag specifying if it can be dimmed.
        * Each fan has three output numbers, one for the fan power, and one each for the up and down output.
        * Each thermostat has a number, typically 0 based, an output numbers for the A/C compressor, low fan, high fan, and furnace outputs.
        * See "Finding Output Numbers" below for output numbers.
- Flashing
    * If using an ESP32 with a USB-C connector and flashing from a Mac, you may need to connect it via a USB hub due to some timing weirdness around resetting the ESP32 into boot mode. I use a USB-C to 4 port USB-A hub with a USB-A to USB-C cable.
- Startup
    * Connect to the ESP32 via Serial Monitor.
    * You should see all of the startup logging.
    * Then a message about being connected to Wifi.
- Pairing
    * In the Home app choose "Add Accessory".
    * Point the camera at this image:
    <br><br>
    ![Pairing Code](/images/defaultSetupCode.png)
    <br><br>
    * Accept that this is an "unsupported" device.
    * Add the bridge and all of your accessories, choosing appropriate rooms for them.
    * Done!

## Finding Output Numbers

The whole multiplex system connects back to a panel with outputs for all of the lights and fans. Each of these outputs has a unique number which may be printed on the panel's cover, and should also be found on a Network Diagnostic screen on the main LCD control screen.

![G7 Outputs](/images/G7_Outputs.jpeg)

*** ***USE CAUTION WHEN ENTERING OUTPUT NUMBERS. THERE ARE OUTPUTS FOR THE RV SLIDES AND THINGS LIKE MOVEABLE BUNKS. YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISTAKENLY PICK ONE OF THOSE OUTPUTS!*** ***

## Supported RV's

Currently the project includes definition files for these RVs in the RV folder:

`Miramar_2020_3202.h` - 2020 Thor Miramar 32.2<br>
`Aria_2019_3901.h` - 2019 Thor Aria 39.1

Additional definition files are welcome.

---
## 3D Printing

- A case will keep the microcontroller isolated from any exposed contacts in the wiring panel.
- STL Files are in the `3D` folder:
    * `RV-Bridge_Box_Bottom.stl`
    * `RV-Bridge_Box_Top.stl`
- Slicer
    * Prusa Slicer 2.5.0
- Filament
    * PETG (handles heat better than PLA)
- Settings
    * Layer height 0.3mm
    * Set extrusion width to 0.55 (eliminates tiny infill strips in walls)
    * Perimeter transitioning threshold angle to 20 (keeps the lettering connected)

## Notes

- If the bridge seems to become unresponsive at some point, verify that the controlling device is on the RV's Wifi and not some other weak Wifi.
- If the bridge doesn't seem available for pairing, it may already think it's paired. Try using the H command via the cli in the serial monitor, then reflash the ESP32 and try again.
- If pairing fails, it seems that sometimes HomeKit gets fussy about a device changing it's properties too much and refuses to pair. You can change the MAC address of the wifi interface by defining '`OVERRIDE_MAC_ADDRESS`' in `config.h` and re-flashing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this can help.
